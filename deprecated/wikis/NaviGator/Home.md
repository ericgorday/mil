Welcome to the NaviGator Wiki! This repository hosts all of the code that is specific to the NaviGator platform. For general information about MIL and our projects, see the [mil_common wiki](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil_common/wiki).

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email Kevin Allen or Daniel Volya.


# What is NaviGator?

NaviGator is a fully An Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) built by undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Florida. It is built to compete in the [Maritime RobotX Challenge](http://www.robotx.org), but it is used for much more. NaviGator is an excellent research platform for students interested in creating autonomous systems. We research and implement all the necessary systems in areas such as controls, perception, motion planning, simulation, and more. While we aim to win, our main goal is to learn.

# Getting Involved
If you are interested in working on software for NaviGator, first read and follow the instructions for getting started in our lab via the [getting started page on the mil_common repo](https://github.com/uf-mil/mil_common/wiki/Getting-Started).

Once you have your system setup with Ubuntu / ROS, you can start to get familiar with the system by [running the simulator](How-To-Run-The-Simulator).

Finally, start writing some code! You can pick one of the [github issues](https://github.com/uf-mil/NaviGator/issues) that seems interesting to you, or come up with some other project. The rest of the software team is here to help you with your project, but ultimately it is up to you do the hard work of learning new things are writing clean and reliable code.
