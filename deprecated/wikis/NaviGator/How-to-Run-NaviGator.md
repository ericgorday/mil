This is a guide on running NaviGator.
## Starting a launch session
We use tmux as it provides a way for others to look at the launch output, and similar to screen, it allows for multiple terminal instances/sessions to run even if there is a loss of connection with the boat.
```shell
tmux new -s launch
```
