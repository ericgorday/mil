# 16.04 Ubuntu catkin_make failed!?
Error:
```Multiple packages found with the same name "roboteq_diagnostics":
- NaviGator/hardware_drivers/roboteq/roboteq_diagnostics
- mil_common/drivers/roboteq/roboteq_diagnostics
Multiple packages found with the same name "roboteq_driver":

Multiple packages found with the same name "roboteq_msgs":

```
Solution:
- Enter the NaviGator repository by entering the alias `nav` in terminal. 
- Checkout into the kinetic-upgrade branch by doing `git checkout upstream/kinetic-upgrade -b kinetic-upgrade`.
- Some old submodules may now be dirty in git `rm -R gnc/lqRRT hardware_drivers/hardware-common`.
- Ensure git submodules are up-to-date by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` in each repository. 
- Enter the mil_common repository by entering `cd ~/mil_ws/src/mil_common/`
- Ensure that the git submodules are up-to-date by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- Enter catkin workspace by `cd ~/mil_ws/`, run `catkin_make clean`.
- If successful, run `catkin_make`.
