Right now, there are three parallel paths to visual navigation:

Ralph & David: Forward camera SLAM and stereo point cloud generation

David: Visual Odometry from conventional optical flow

Tess: PTAM/DTAM + MonoSLAM for down-camera

Jake: SVO + MonoSLAM for down-camera

# Considerations
* Work in an underwater "outdoor" environment
* Handle occlusion due to opaqueness of water
* Handle occlusion in general
* Provide a motion estimate based on world knowledge, and not just integrating velocity (i.e. DVL)
* Generate a traversibility map
* Work in real-time

# Questions
* Do we need to enhance the simulator to support visual SLAM activities?
* Do we need better cameras?
* Should we consider using a signed Distance Function (SDF) for mapping? The researchers at TMU show that is
significantly faster than Octrees and claim that it is robust to noise and occlusion. Their paper [5] is listed under references.

# Notes
* Down-camera and forward camera SLAM are almost certainly different problems. Each works with remarkably different scene disparity, and the forward cameras work with much more occlusion than the down-camera


# Down-Camera

## Implementation Milestones

Topics that appear to be common to essentially every monocular SLAM implementation, or will likely come in handy
* Depth-Filter

* 2D-2D correspondence -> 3D transform estimation

* Sparse bundle adjustment for depth initialization (Tools exist for this)

## Notes
* PTAM is widely regarded as one of the best MAV SLAM approaches

* **Why don't we just gather features and do the 5-pt algorithm?**
    * The results are extremely noisy
    * Can't make a useful map/recover scene depth
    * No way to reason about the quality of the track produced
    * *Each relative pose is known only to a translational scaling!!!!*
