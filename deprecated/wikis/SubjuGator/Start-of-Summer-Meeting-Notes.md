Main issues: right now:
* Prop slip
* Shroud alignment (might aggravate prop slippage)
* Hard-Soft calibration
* 3d pose estimation for objects robust to Transdec lighting and occlusion
  + Imaging sonar has seemed like a good source of data for detecting hard objects (at least with the right gains)
  + Stereo has seemed like a good way of segmenting objects
    - (David will try to validate the currently used algorithm on bags from robosub2016 by 5/26/17)
  + PNP from detected features in a single camera
