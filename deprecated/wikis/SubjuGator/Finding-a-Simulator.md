We required a full dynamic simulation of the Sub. This included some things listed in the considerations section of this page. After much consideration, we have settled on Gazebo. For all of it's bugs, it is still the cleanest to integrate into our stack and configure.

# Tools

### V-REP
- Very fully featured
- Has in-built velodyne support
- Hard to configure
- No built-in water resistance

### Gazebo
- Bloated
- Hard to configure
- No built-in water resistance

### UWSim
- Already has DVL, imaging sonar, depth sensor support
- Water-resistance support
- Surface wave support (But apparently not physical simulation?)
- Hard to install
- Hard to configure

#### Installing UWSIM
1. Following the instructions for [source-based installation avoiding catkin_make_isolated](http://www.irs.uji.es/uwsim/wiki/index.php?title=Installing_UWSim#Source-based_installation_in_Groovy_and_later_distributions_avoiding_catkin_make_isolated)

2. Change all of the instance of 'hydro' to 'indigo'

3. `rosrun uwsim uwsim`

### Implement our own  -- NOTE for posterity, we chose this.
- Will take time
- Have to support internally
- Will do everything we want exactly the way we want it
- We can easily adapt it to RobotX

# Considerations

- Collision
- Nonlinear dynamics (Can't just use state-transition matrices)
- Arbitrary rotations
- Water resistance
- Camera view simulation (Grab color framebuffer)
- Depth-imaging simulation (Grab depth buffer)
- Must be able to do monte-carlo simulation
- Must be able to run many simulations in faster-than-real-time, and without graphics
- Should (Though is not necessarily required to) keep in mind adaptation to support RobotX surface vessel

## Non-simulation
When developing simulation visualization, we should do so with the intention of reusing it for visualizing real data.

- Current path estimates
- Thruster efforts
- etc
