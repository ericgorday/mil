This wiki serves as the main landing page for the uf-mil Github organization and contains general information about the lab as well as documentation of the software in this repository. The mil_common repository contains all of the ROS packages, scripts, and libraries that are common to all MIL vehicles. This allows us to avoid duplicating code as well as build up a library of useful tools.

# General Information

The [Machine Intelligence Lab (MIL)](http://mil.ufl.edu/) focuses on a few different projects throughout the year. These include the following vehicles:
* [SubjuGator](http://subjugator.org) - An Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) that is entered in the [RoboSub competition](http://www.robonation.org/competition/robosub). [**_Read the wiki!_**](https://github.com/uf-mil/SubjuGator/wiki)
* [PropaGator](http://propagator.org) - An Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) that is entered in the [RoboBoat competition](http://www.robonation.org/competition/roboboat)
* [NaviGator](http://www.navigatoruf.org) - An Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) that is entered in the [Maritime RobotX Challenge](https://www.robotx.org)

# Getting involved

The project that is currently active typically depends on which competition date is nearest. A fool proof way to check is to look at the activity on our Github organization, [uf-mil](https://github.com/uf-mil) or simply stop by our lab on the UF main campus in MAEC 126.

This wiki contains a lot of information on the lab's practices, policies, and software. The wiki's on each project contain vehicle-specific information. The team lead for each project is usually listed on the wiki home page of that project, so feel free to email them for more information.

If you have decided to develop for one of our projects, we recommend checking out the [[Getting Started]] page on this wiki. It will get your machine set up to work with our software stack and refer you to some useful tutorials for the libraries and programs we make use of.
