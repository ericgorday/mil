**DEPRECATED: This page contains outdated information. It is based on the simulator for SubjuGator before the migration to Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic. We have opted to use our in house machines over AWS. They have more processing power and we don't have to pay to use them.**

Setting up AWS for gazebo
=========================


* You want gazebo5
* Sometimes, you have to add the google nameserver (8.8.8.8) to /etc/resolv.conf
* You might have to manually set up /etc/apt/sources.list
* Make sure opengl is installed
* [gzweb](http://gazebosim.org/gzweb), the web Gazebo UI, is your best friend
* You'll probably have to do [this stuff](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19856192/run-opengl-on-aws-gpu-instances-with-centos)
* (And nvidia stuff)[https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/547588/error-installing-nvidia-drivers-on-x86_64-amazon-ec2-gpu-cluster-t20-gpu-/]
* Watch out for the jeepie-jeekies!


# ROS IP
You can subscribe & publish to an EC2 instance

#### On the EC2 machine
* Figure out the public IP and export ROS_IP=that
    * when you start roscore, it will claim to find an error
    * export ROS_IP=`curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4`



#### On your own machine

* Setet your own machine's ROS_IP
* And set your machine's rosmaster


I use...

```shell
# alias setrosip='export ROS_IP=`hostname -I | cut -f1 -d" "`'
alias setrosip='export ROS_IP=`wget http://ipinfo.io/ip -qO -`'

chros() {
    setrosip;
    export ROS_MASTER_URI="http://$1:11311";
}
```


# Commands
```shell
sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-virtual
```

Might have to uninstall linux-image-extra-virtual or -...generic

Install
```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

Set the busid
```
lspci | grep -i nvidia
# You'll get some numbers that look like 0:2.1, replace the . with w :
sudo nvidia-xconfig -a --use-display-device=None --virtual=1280x1024 --busid=X:X:X

sudo /usr/bin/X :0 &
export DISPLAY=:0

```

# Errors
