Any team member can edit the project wikis at any time. The contribution rules are much more lax than that of the regular repositories. You do not need to ask permission or submit a pull request to make changes, but there are still a few requirements:

* Use proper English spelling and grammar
* Use proper formatting to make an easily readable page (Section headers, links, bolding, etc)

When it comes to the wikis, no amount of information is too much information so long as the important parts of your page are easy to identify.

A new page will not immediately appear in the sidebar, you will have to manually add it to the custom sidebar we use. Put it in the appropriate section, or create a new one if necessary.
